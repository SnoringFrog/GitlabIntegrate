Thank you for installing GitlabIntegrate! 

*********************NOTICE*********************
You're probably seeing this document because 
you haven't configured your host and token yet. 

This document explains how to do that to stop 
this from appearing every time you try to use 
GitlabIntegrate.
************************************************

Basic Usage
-----------
GitlabIntegrate functions can be accessed via the menu (Tools -> GitlabIntegrate) or with a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+X (Windows/Linux), Cmd+Shift+X (Mac))

Configuration
-------------
Before using GitlabIntegrate, you should configure the User Settings file. User settings can be found 3 ways (you may need to create the file if it doesn't exist):
1. Via the menu at 
	Preferences -> Package Settings -> Gitlab Integrate -> Settings - User
2. Via the menu at
	Tools -> Gitlab Integrate -> Access User Settings
3. Via file browser at
	[sublime installation directory]/Packages/User/GitlabIntegrate.sublime-settings 

Then, copy and paste the following text into the file (replacing any text already there), editing the necessary fields:
{
	//Displays the intro document on startup
	"gli_display_intro": false,

	//Your Gitlab host
	"gli_project_host": "",

	//Your Gitlab user token, found at [host]/profile/account 
	"gli_user_token": "",

	/*
	The default project ID.
	This can be found by running GitlabIntegrate's "Get Project IDs" command after configuring your host and user_token. All the projects you have access to should be listed with their IDs.
	*/
	"gli_project_id": 0
}
